A central focus of the course revolved around grasping the concept of prosthetic memory‚Äîhow it takes shape and is utilized. Drawing from my comprehension of the potent formation of prosthetic memory through simulation, immersion, and media, I embarked on a project that harnesses technology to engage with this concept. In an era dominated by Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence, the potential to craft prosthetic or fabricated memories of historical events is profound. While this website may not entirely construct an immersive metaverse of 'At Swim, Two Boys,' particularly regarding the Easter Rising, it aspires to enrich the prosthetic memory cultivated by the class through the novel by introducing supplementary contexts and engaging additional senses."

Likewise, the haunting melody and lyrics of 'Who Fears to Speak of Easter Week' serve as a musical vessel that carries the emotions, narratives, and collective memory of the Rising, ensuring that its legacy lives on through the power of music and song. In the realm of literature and text, echoes of the Rising resonate through the writings of authors like James Joyce and W.B. Yeats, who, through their works, have embedded the spirit of 1916 in the city's cultural consciousness for generations to come."
